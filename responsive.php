		<p>Responsive websites are the future! They allow sites adapt to different screen sizes. Thus, not minding whatever device used to browse the site, the web visitors get the best possible view of the website. <a href="http://www.paqadvault.com">Paqad Solution</a> itself is responsive.</p>

<p>People who browse on-the-go may have needs varying from those sitting at a desk. This is why Responsive websites are designed to re-organize themselves automatically according to the device viewing them, so the same website provides a great experience in all situations. Desktops get a full-blown interface with videos, large images and animations while Smart-phones get a simplified website that runs fast without the bells and whistles and Tablets and notebooks get something in between.</p>

<p>Mobile environments require simpler navigation, focused content and fast page loads. If a website has a responsive design the user does not have to manipulate the site using “pinch and zoom” and the flow of content is more appropriate for a smaller screen. The site may reduce the amount of content presented to the mobile browser, thus, less clutter and easier use</p>

<p>Responsive design works by grouping similar devices by screen size to establish the target size ‘break points’ your site is developed for. So you’re not getting the ‘iPhone’ version of a site, you get the version intended for all smart-phones. The website is flexible and responds to the exact size of the screen viewing it. When there is a new device with a little larger or smaller screen than your target, the site will respond properly too.</p>

<p>By essentially giving a custom solution for each mobile platform, our responsive website design makes for a better user experience on a wider range of devices.</p>

Future Friendly

<p>Responsive design is a forward-thinking technology which makes it ‘future proof’. This means that it makes sites that will work on next year’s devices. One of the major challenges in providing excellent websites for the mobile user is the vast number of devices emerging in the market place.</p>
